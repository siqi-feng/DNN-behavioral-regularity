**Deep neural networks for choice analysis: Improving monotonicity for interpretation by regularization**

The research is based on Shenhao's paper: [Deep neural networks for choice analysis: Extracting complete economic information for interpretation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2020.102701). The code will be continuously updated. The manuscript and results are primitive :)
